# Restaurants and Calories Web App 

Live Demo: https://web-app-capstone--yuliakrimerman.repl.co/ 

## Summary


The purpose of this app is to allow people to search for restaurants and places to dine out, but also to keep track of the calories
that they consume when they eat outside. It's very useful for people who love to explore new dining places but don't want to loose 
track of the calorie intake because they are on a diet, have a calorie goal they want to achieve or are just mindful of they eat and 
how much calories it's worth. 

The App is divided in 2 parts. The first part requires the user to insert a city or a zipcode and a searchradius for the restaurants
in the desired area. It provides results of  Google maps and a list of restaurants that are displayed on the map.
The second part requires the user to type in any kind of food or meal they have consumed in one of the restaurants. The results 
that are returned is an approximate estimate of the calories in that meal based on average size of the meal.
