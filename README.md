# Restaurants and Calories Web App 

## Summary 

The purpose of this app is to allow people to search for restaurants and places to dine out, but also to keep track of the calories
that they consume when they eat outside. It's very useful for people who love to explore new dining places but don't want to loose 
track of the calorie intake because they are on a diet, have a calorie goal they want to achieve or are just mindful of they eat and 
how much calories it's worth. 
The App is divided in 2 parts. The first part requires the user to insert a city or a zipcode and a search
radius for the restaurants in the desired area.It provides a results of maps and a list of restaurants that is displayed on the map.
And the second part requires the user to type in any kind of food or meal they have consumed in one of the restaurants. The results 
that are returned is an approximate estimate of the calorie in that meal based on average size of the meal.
